# Getting Into Information Security

I often see the question posed either to myself or to others on the web... "How do I get started in information security". This certainly depends on your current knowledge-set but if I was to assume you knew practically nothing, this is what I would recommend...

1. Do you know what *type* of information security job you want to do? If not, don't worry - most entry level people wouldn't in this case, research the different types of security jobs there are. This includes (but is not limited to) security administration, web application security, identity & access management, risk management, policy and compliance, penetration testing, vulnerability management and more! A good place to start looking for what kinds of jobs there are and what specific skills they require would be recruiting sites (Monster, LinkedIn etc...) or your old pal Google.
1. OK so maybe you know what you want to do or maybe you don't - either way, you're going to need to learn stuff. The "Basic Security Domains" I've laid out in the section below is a guide to some *basic* knowledge areas that security professionals can lean on no matter what role they ultimately get into.
1. Recruiters, hiring managers, other security pros and the infosec industry at large LOVES certifications. The Security+ certifications is a great entry level cert to not only show that you are serious about security but also it is a great introduction to most of the foundational security concepts you will need throughout your career. This certification is a must-get in my opinion. As you learn more, and with time/budget willing, begin to take a look at other certification options. (These are listed in the Resources section.)
1. Don't be afraid to take an entry infosec position (no matter what it is in) even if it's not exactly what you are looking for at first. Experience is the number one thing in this field and it stands out the greatest to recruiters and hiring managers.
1. Start back at step 1 and repeat these steps all over again!

Some other points...
* Do you need a computer science, IT, or security related degree? - The short answer is no. The long answer is that a degree will definitely help you find an entry level position, will give you a leg up on candidates who don't have one, will help you bypass certain hiring filters (filters that would exclude non-degree-holding candiates) and of course give you base knowledge that is crucial for providing value to your potential employer.
* Demonstrate and exercise your *passion*. This is done in a variety of ways. Create a github account and create your own projects or contribute to others. Stand up a home-lab and practice networking or hacking or web development. Create an AWS account and learn about cloud architecture. Listen to security podcasts. These are just some ideas but you will of course learn more as you dedicate yourself to the trade and when the time comes that you are interviewing for a position, these are talking points that can often win over prospective employers and make you stand out over the competition.
* Join the community. The security community is a friendly, thriving, and dynamic community. There are countless meetup groups, conferences, online forums and more that can be joined. Networking and learning from others in the community helps you accelerate growth and demonstrate your passion.
* GOOGLE! Just about everything you could want to learn is available online. With a little motivation and an attitude towards learning, this is really all you need.


## Basic Security Domains

The domains below represent (in general) the expected knowledge areas for security professionals. Not every security professional necessarily needs to be an expert in each (with the exception of the "Security Fundamentals" domain) but knowing as much as you can in each will ensure you are well rounded. Of the areas below, the Security Fundamentals domain is (obviously) paramount. Secondary (in importance) would be Scripting and "OS Fundamentals". The last 3 will vary in importance even more so than the second two depending on the nature of the security role you are interested in.

* Security Fundamentals (See Security+ Curriculum - https://certification.comptia.org/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia-security-sy0-401.pdf)
* Scripting (Python, Ruby, Powershell, Bash, Perl, etc...)
* OS Fundamentals (Linux, Windows)
* Networking (TCP/IP, Network Protocols, Routing/Switching, etc...)
* Web Applications (HTTP, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, REST, SQL, etc...)
* Programming (Java, C, C++, etc...)

There are of course MANY other domains, some of which are specific to the security roles they belong to. As you get more and more into the field, you will learn what these are.
